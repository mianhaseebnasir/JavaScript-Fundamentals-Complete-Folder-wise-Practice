JavaScript Fundamentals – Complete Folder-wise Practice

This repository contains my complete JavaScript learning journey, organized in a clear, folder-wise structure.
Each folder covers one specific JavaScript concept, starting from basic syntax to arrays, functions, ES6 features, and small practical tasks. 
This project is specially designed for beginners who want to understand JavaScript step by step with hands-on practice.
I created this repository for learning, teaching, and revision purposes. Every folder includes simple and understandable code examples.
